 The largest dataset selected and used originated from the National Institute of Justice’s (NIJ’s) Recidivism Forecasting Challenge <https://data.ojp.usdoj.gov/Courts/NIJ-s-Recidivism-Challenge-Full-Dataset/ynf5-u8nk/about_data>. This is a fairly large, publicly available, dataset consisting of data on over 25,000 individuals released from correctional facilities in Georgia between January 2013 and December 2015. An additional field for Correctional Facility ID was added to this dataset to allow for creating a relationship with other, partially and/or fully fictitious, data sets. The actual correctional facility each individual record on the NIJ’s Recidivism Dataset is unknown, so for the purpose of this analysis a correctional facility ID was randomly assigned to each record.
The entries in the Correctional Facilities dataset were established using available evidence and sources, and wherever available, factual information was used. The facility security level and average daily inmate population from the list of actual correctional facilities in Georgia were obtained from the Georgia Department of Corrections Find a Location webpage <https://gdc.georgia.gov/locations>. The listed average hourly wage of correctional officers for each correctional facility was randomly assigned and was based on data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics percentile wage estimates for correctional officers and jailers <https://www.bls.gov/oes/2019/may/oes333012.htm>. The average inmate-to-correctional officer ratio has also been randomly determined and assigned to each correctional institution and was determined based upon multiple resources indicating that Georgia’s ratios range from 4.82 prisoners per guard up to one officer for every 200 prisoners, and with the Federal Bureau of Prison’s indicated baseline ratio of one guard for every 15 inmates <https://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/statistics_staff_staffing_ratios.jsp>.
The records making up the EBRR Programs and EBRR Program Cohorts tables all represent fictitious entries of different types of EBRR programs being held at a given, randomly assigned, correctional facility, as well as fictitious enrollment, attendance, and completion numbers for each of the entries, and average number of cohort hours and employee hours per cohort.
